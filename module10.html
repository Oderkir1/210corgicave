		<p>So far, I have been very consistent in keeping the content of my portfolio website separate from the presentation. Using CodePen.io, I have been able to draft and structure my content in HTML, while concurrently designing the presentation in CSS. If something was not looking the way I wanted, I could adjust the CSS accordingly, but if something was clearly not working, I had the CSS and HTML code side-by-side for easy review. If I wanted to style a specific portion of content, I utilized classes and ids in HTML so that I could continue to design the presentation in CSS. One presentation piece that I do have to keep in my HTML is the Google font, Oregano, that I selected to use for my portfolio’s headers. The code is very similar to the code used to refer to the CSS sheet, and is located within the "head" tag</p>

		<p>Most of my difficulties have stemmed from trying to position content in certain ways. For the most part I have been able to figure out ways to achieve the look I’m aiming for, but a few things have escaped me. One main example that is currently obvious when viewing my page is my footer content. The entire footer should be in a horizontal line, but I have been unsuccessful in using CSS to display the footer in a line. Rather than playing around with the HTML, I have just left everything alone. My hope is that the positioning lessons in Codeacademy will clear up my confusion about positioning, and then I can use the skills I learn to style the footer, and whatever of the presentation remains unfinished.</p>

		<p class="caption">The "footer" as it appeared on my portfolio website as of March 18, 2014.</p>
		<p>Moving forward, I will be using notepad++ to manage my HTML and CSS files for my portfolio, but I will still be referring back to CodePen.io if I am playing around with a certain area or trying to test out different looks. This way, I can have a live website, while still update the code with presentation separate from content.</p>
